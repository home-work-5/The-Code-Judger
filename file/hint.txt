First we generate the output of "toJudge" Code and put it in folder "judgeOut" with OPTION "0".

Then with OPTION "1" we generate output of "right" code and put it in filde "out" and then compare these outputs.


 
If they  gave us the input and outputs only. We use OPTION "3" to generate outputs to folder "judgeOut" and then judge it.
